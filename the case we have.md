CASE TYPE:
Late Tax Declarations & Compliance Regularization

================================
CASE SUMMARY
================================
- Company established and registered with Egyptian Tax Authority.
- No VAT declarations submitted since January 2025 until January 2026.
- No annual income tax declarations submitted for:
  - Year 2024
  - Year 2025
- Approximately 150 tax invoices exist during this period:
  - Sales invoices
  - Purchase invoices
- Delay reason:
  - Tax portal was inaccessible / technical issues prevented submission.
- No official tax audit or tax assessment has been initiated yet.

================================
OBJECTIVE
================================
Regularize the company’s tax position with minimal penalties by:
- Submitting all missing declarations voluntarily
- Preparing legally correct figures
- Avoiding estimated tax assessment or tax evasion classification

================================
LEGAL BASIS
================================
- Unified Tax Procedures Law No. 206 of 2020:
  - Voluntary submission before tax audit reduces penalties.
- VAT Law No. 67 of 2016:
  - VAT declarations are period-based (monthly).
- Egyptian Tax Authority practice:
  - Each tax period requires a separate declaration.
  - Late submission is penalized, non-submission is more severe.

================================
SYSTEM REQUIRED ACTIONS
================================

STEP 1: Period Identification
- Identify all missing VAT periods:
  - January 2025 → December 2025
- Identify missing annual declarations:
  - Income tax 2024
  - Income tax 2025

--------------------------------

STEP 2: Invoice Allocation
- Distribute all invoices strictly by issue date.
- Classify invoices into:
  - Output VAT (sales)
  - Input VAT (purchases)
- Ignore invoices outside VAT scope.

--------------------------------

STEP 3: Monthly VAT Calculation
For EACH month:
- Calculate total taxable sales
- Calculate output VAT
- Calculate deductible input VAT
- Compute VAT payable or credit
- Allow zero declarations where applicable

Each month must be handled independently.

--------------------------------

STEP 4: VAT Declarations Preparation
- Prepare a VAT declaration dataset for EACH month.
- Do NOT combine months into one declaration.
- Mark declarations as:
  - Late submission
  - Voluntary submission

--------------------------------

STEP 5: Annual Tax Preparation
- Aggregate yearly financial results for:
  - 2024
  - 2025
- Prepare annual income tax summaries:
  - Revenue
  - Costs
  - Net result (profit or loss)
- Prepare data even if:
  - No profit
  - Loss occurred

--------------------------------

STEP 6: Risk & Penalty Awareness
- Flag all declarations as late.
- DO NOT calculate penalties automatically unless explicitly configured.
- Provide estimated exposure only as informational notes.

--------------------------------

STEP 7: Supporting Notes
- Generate a short explanation note stating:
  - Delay reason was technical / portal-related.
  - Declarations are submitted voluntarily.
  - No intent of tax evasion.

================================
SYSTEM OUTPUT EXPECTATION
================================
The system must output:

1. List of missing VAT declarations (month by month)
2. VAT figures for each month
3. Annual tax summaries for 2024 and 2025
4. Clear indication that:
   - Submissions are late
   - Submissions are voluntary
5. Notes for accountant review before submission

================================
IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS
================================
- Do not merge tax periods.
- Do not assume missing data.
- Do not hide late status.
- Accuracy and completeness are higher priority than speed.

================================
FINAL GOAL
================================
Provide clean, legally correct tax figures that allow:
- Fast submission on the tax portal
- Reduced penalties
- No estimated tax assessment
- Accountant signature without recalculation
